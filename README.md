# Splitting-an-array-into-two-equal-sum-sub-arrays

1. Define an array of non-negative numbers.
2. The split function will convert the given array into two sub arrays with equal sum.
3. The final output provides the total sum of thegiven array and the corresponding sub-arrays

*The return condition can also be defined with the sum-check statement at the end if no printing of the sub-arrays is required even in case of an error.

**Array divisibility condition at the end checks if the sum of the generated sub-array is equal or not. This is required to ensure the divisibility in case few of the numbers in the original array has a high value.
